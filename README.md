# PowerBI_Project
Superstore Dashboard


Things I have learnt while building this dashboard are:
 -Getting data into Power BI and navigating through Power BI.
 -Preparing different kind of visuals, charts and reports.
 -Cleaning the data in power query editor by removing unnecessary rows, renaming columns etc.
 - Appending and merging of two tables. Building relationships between tables.
 -Formatting the report page and visuals created.
